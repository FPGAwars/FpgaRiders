[![Icestudio][icestudio-image]][icestudio-url]
![Version][version-image]

Collection of Blocks designed by Icestudio users 

## Documentation
Find all the information on the [WIKI page](https://github.com/FPGAwars/FpgaRiders/wiki)  

categories:

1- In-Outs		: for Fpga inputs outputs dealing (tri-state, de-bouncing, boutons of every sort, mechanical encoders ... )

2- LogicCircuits	: basic Gates, Combinatory and sequential logic, + special Tim rudy 74LS,.. collection (thanks to him for that job!)  (It can be fun for emulating, with an fpgaboard, a circuit that we can later solder with traditional ICs (not all DiY applications need the final use of a 100KLuts  FPGA ;-) )

3- Interface	: simple protocol interfaces ( thaht can be used with almost any periferal comunicating with thaht protocol),   complex interfaces ( oriented to the use of a single, particular peripheral...)

4- Memories	: FF, Bram, external memories controller,...

5- Math		: More " complex" Multi-bit math operations (@ Democrito ;-))

6- Processing	: Cpu, DSP, ...,  and the much simpler State-machines
	
7- Sound		: for the pleasure of your hears :-)

8- Graphics	: for the pleasure of your Eyes :-)

9- Various		: guess what! :-)
